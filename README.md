# IDP_105

Team 105's github repository for the Cambridge IB 2024 IDP project (Lent 1).

## Developing environment

We used the platform.io extentsion for Visual Studio Code to program our robot. The libraries used were:

* arduino-libraries/Servo@^1.2.1
* dfrobot/DFRobot_VL53L0X@^1.0.0
* adafruit/Adafruit Motor Shield V2 Library@^1.1.3
* SPI
* sstaub/Ticker@^4.4.0

## Overall code layout

The majority of functions are within the 'src' file, including all the line following functions and block collection used in the run up to and in the final competition.
Class declarations and header files are in the 'include' file, while electronic testing functions were all within the 'Electronics_Testing' file.
